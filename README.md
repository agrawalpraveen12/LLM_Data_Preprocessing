# LLM Data Preprocessing  

This repository contains a preprocessing pipeline for preparing datasets for **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. It includes utilities for cleaning, formatting, and structuring text data before training or fine-tuning.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Text cleaning (removing special characters, extra spaces, unwanted symbols)  
- Tokenization-ready formatting  
- Train/validation split support  
- Support for custom datasets  
- Easy-to-extend Jupyter notebook workflow
